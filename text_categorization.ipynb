It also possible to weight precision or recall more heavily than the other if you have a preference. E.g., in most web searches you might weight precision more highly if you're satisfied with a single documment that answers your question. When searching for legal precedents, you might value recall more highly because you don't want to miss something that could be relevant to a case.
